description:

    * The [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) ( kb )
      aims to be a data structure able to:

        * represent /multiple/ facts about the source code repo
        * from /various/ programming languages
        * each fact can be translated to a [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) fact
        * facts can be combined to create [predicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_%28logic%29)
        * predictaes can be combined to formulate /security queries/

    * [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) facts describe relations between:

        * code locations
        * const strings
        * const integers

    * [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) facts can be /combined/:

        * create /expressive/ queries from /simple/ facts
        * [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction)
        * [disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction)
        * [negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation)

    * [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) queries are /easy/ to write:

        * you /don't/ have to be a Prolog expert
        * copy-paste the basic facts to /any/ [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)
        * explain in plain English your query's purpose
        * et voil√† !
